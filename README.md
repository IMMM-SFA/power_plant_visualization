## CERF Visualization: Projected locations of new natural gas combined cycle power plants (with recirculating cooling) in Wyoming, USA (2020-2050)

### Description
Visualization of CERF outputs for years 2030-2050 in 5-year time steps for a region in Wyoming, USA.  This visualization was built using a custom CesiumJS application.  The region of interest was zoomed into and then the app shows the layered application of natural gas combined cycle power plants (with recirculating cooling) suitability criteria, show the siting for each year in planform, simulates the selection of a site using Net Locational Cost, and then zooms into to show a single functional gas plant and simulates its connection to the grid.
